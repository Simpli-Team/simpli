# Welcome to Simpli

We're excited to introduce **Simpli**, a modern documentation framework built for speed and simplicity.

## Why Another Documentation Framework?

After using various documentation tools, we realized there was a gap in the market for a framework that combines:

- **Performance**: Fast builds and instant HMR
- **Simplicity**: Zero-config with smart defaults
- **Modernity**: Latest React, TypeScript, and build tools

## What's Next?

Stay tuned for more updates as we continue to improve Simpli!
